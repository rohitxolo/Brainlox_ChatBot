#🧠 Brainlox Chatbot: A Smart Course Assistant 🤖
The Brainlox Chatbot is a custom conversational AI designed to help users explore and learn about technical courses offered on the Brainlox platform. Built using LangChain, Flask, and ChromaDB, this chatbot extracts course data, generates embeddings, and provides an interactive API for seamless conversations.

Whether you're a student looking for the right course or an enthusiast exploring technical topics, this chatbot serves as your intelligent assistant, answering questions and providing insights about Brainlox's technical courses.

#🌟 Key Features
#📥 Data Extraction:

Automatically extracts course details from the Brainlox website using LangChain's URL Loader.

Saves the extracted data in a structured format for further processing.

#🧩 Embeddings & Vector Storage:

Generates embeddings using Sentence Transformers to understand the context of course data.

Stores embeddings in ChromaDB, a vector database, for efficient retrieval.

#🤖 Conversational AI:

Uses LangChain to create a conversational chain for natural interactions.

Answers user queries about Brainlox courses, such as course details, topics, and recommendations.

#🌐 RESTful API:

Provides a Flask-based API for easy integration with front-end applications or other services.

Supports POST requests to interact with the chatbot.

#🛠️ Modular & Scalable:

The project is structured into modular components (data extraction, embeddings, chatbot logic, and API) for easy maintenance and scalability.

#🚀 Use Cases
Students: Quickly find information about technical courses, such as course content, prerequisites, and learning outcomes.

Educators: Explore course offerings and understand how they align with their teaching goals.

Developers: Use the chatbot as a template to build custom conversational AI for other websites or datasets.

#🛠️ Technologies Used
LangChain: For data extraction, embeddings, and conversational AI.

Flask: To create a RESTful API for the chatbot.

ChromaDB: For storing and retrieving vector embeddings.

Sentence Transformers: To generate embeddings for course data.

BeautifulSoup & Requests: For web scraping and data extraction (if needed).
